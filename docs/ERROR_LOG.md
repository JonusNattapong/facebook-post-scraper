## Active Errors

### Error #1 - Caption Extraction Includes Random/Unwanted Text
**Date Reported**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: üî¥ Open

#### Problem Description
When extracting the caption from Facebook posts, the webhook receives the caption field with many random texts included - not just the actual post caption. The extraction is too broad and captures UI elements, comments, engagement text, and other unwanted content.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Configure n8n webhook URL in extension
2. Right-click on any Facebook post
3. Select "üì§ Send to n8n"
4. Check the webhook data received - caption field contains extra text

#### Expected Behavior
Caption should contain ONLY the actual post text/caption written by the author.

#### Actual Behavior
Caption contains the post text plus many other random texts from the page (UI elements, buttons, comments snippets, engagement stats, etc.)

#### Error Messages/Logs
```
No error messages - the extraction works but captures too much content
```

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Current Implementation** (content.js:107-149):
- Uses overly broad selector: `querySelectorAll('[dir="auto"], div, span, p')`
- This captures EVERY div, span, and paragraph in the entire post
- Filters are insufficient - only removes text < 20 chars and basic UI text
- Takes longest text by default, which may include accumulated junk

**Identified Problems:**

1. **Problem #1: Too Broad Selector**
   - `querySelectorAll('[dir="auto"], div, span, p')` matches hundreds of elements
   - Captures comments section, engagement stats, metadata, buttons, etc.
   - No specific targeting of actual caption container

2. **Problem #2: Weak Filtering**
   - Only filters out text < 20 chars and basic UI patterns
   - Doesn't filter: author names, timestamps, "See translation", nested comments, "View more comments", hashtag suggestions, etc.
   - UI text patterns are limited to English and Thai only

3. **Problem #3: "Longest Text" Strategy**
   - Assumes longest text = caption (line 141: `sort((a, b) => b.length - a.length)`)
   - Can fail if comments section or other elements have accumulated longer text
   - Doesn't prioritize based on DOM position

4. **Problem #4: TextContent Extraction**
   - `textContent` on parent containers includes ALL nested text
   - If iterating through parent divs, gets nested children text repeatedly
   - Creates duplicates and accumulates unwanted text

5. **Problem #5: No "See More" Click**
   - Comment at line 107 mentions "SIMPLE approach"
   - Doesn't try to expand truncated captions before extraction
   - May get incomplete text with "See more" suffix

#### Possible Solutions

**Solution A: Use Specific Caption Selectors (RECOMMENDED)**
- Target specific Facebook caption containers first
- Known selectors: `[data-ad-comet-preview="message"]`, `[data-ad-preview="message"]`
- Fallback to more specific selectors like `[dir="auto"][style*="text-align: start"]` near top of post
- Only use broad selectors as last resort

**Solution B: Click "See More" Button**
- Find and click `<div role="button">See more</div>` or similar
- Wait briefly for expansion
- Then extract full caption text
- Prevents partial text extraction

**Solution C: Position-Based Filtering**
- Only look for caption in first 30% of post height
- Caption is always near top, below author
- Exclude elements below a certain vertical threshold

**Solution D: Better Text Filtering**
- Expand filter patterns to exclude:
  - Timestamps (e.g., "5 hrs", "Yesterday at 10:30 AM")
  - Action links ("See translation", "View previous comments", "Write a comment")
  - Author information
  - URLs/links that aren't part of caption
- Add more language support

**Solution E: Structural Approach**
- Find author element first
- Look for next sibling or nearby element with substantial text
- Caption is usually immediately after author name
- Use DOM hierarchy instead of text length

**Solution F: Exclude Comments Section**
- Identify comments container (often has `[aria-label*="comment"]`)
- Exclude all elements within comments section
- Prevents comment text from being captured

**Solution G: Direct Children Only**
- Instead of `querySelectorAll` on all descendants
- Only look at direct children of specific post sections
- Prevents nested content accumulation

#### Solution Attempts

**Attempt #1** - [Date: 2025-10-02]
- **Approach**: Solution A - Use Specific Caption Selectors
- **Strategy**:
  - Priority 1: Target Facebook's specific caption data attributes (`[data-ad-comet-preview="message"]`, `[data-ad-preview="message"]`)
  - Priority 2: Use more specific selectors for post body text containers
  - Priority 3: Fall back to current broad approach only if specific selectors fail
  - Remove "longest text" logic - take first match from specific selectors
- **Implementation**:
  - File: `content.js` lines 107-203
  - Replaced broad `querySelectorAll('[dir="auto"], div, span, p')` with 3-tier approach
  - **Tier 1**: Specific Facebook data attributes (4 selectors)
  - **Tier 2**: Structural filtering - `div[dir="auto"]` with:
    - Minimum text length (20+ chars)
    - UI text exclusion (Like, Comment, Share, engagement stats, "See translation")
    - Comments section exclusion via `closest('[aria-label*="comment"]')`
    - Minimal nesting check (< 5 child divs)
  - **Tier 3**: Fallback to first substantial `[dir="auto"]` text block (30+ chars)
  - Enhanced cleanup: removes "See more" suffixes and UI text patterns
  - Takes FIRST match instead of longest text
- **Result**: ‚ùå Failed
- **Notes**: User reported problem still occurs. Caption still includes unwanted/random text.
  - Specific selectors (Tier 1) likely don't match Facebook's current DOM structure
  - Structural approach (Tier 2) still too broad - captures nested content
  - Comments section exclusion not sufficient to prevent all unwanted text
  - **Learning**: DOM-based detection is fragile and unreliable for Facebook's dynamic structure

**Attempt #2** - [Date: 2025-10-02]
- **Approach**: Text Selection (User Highlight) with Auto-Detection Fallback (HYBRID)
- **Strategy**:
  - **Primary**: If user has selected/highlighted text ‚Üí Use that as caption (100% accurate)
  - **Fallback**: If no selection ‚Üí Use auto-detection (current approach from Attempt #1)
  - Check if selection is within the post boundary (not from outside)
  - This gives user full control while maintaining convenience
- **Implementation**:
  - File: `content.js` lines ~110-115 (before current caption extraction)
  - Add `window.getSelection().toString()` check
  - Validate selection is not empty and is within `postElement`
  - If valid selection exists ‚Üí `captionText = selection`, skip auto-detection
  - If no selection ‚Üí Run existing 3-tier auto-detection logic
  - Add console log to indicate which method was used
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Success - Confirmed Working by User
- **Code Changes**:
  - Added lines 112-133 in `content.js`
  - Checks `window.getSelection().toString()` for highlighted text
  - Validates selection is within `postElement` boundary
  - If valid selection found ‚Üí Use it as caption (skips auto-detection)
  - If no selection ‚Üí Falls back to 3-tier auto-detection from Attempt #1
  - Added detailed console logs for debugging
- **Testing Instructions**:
  1. Reload extension in `chrome://extensions`
  2. Refresh Facebook page
  3. **Test Case A**: Highlight caption text ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí Send to n8n
     - Expected: Caption should be exactly what you highlighted (check console: "Using user-selected text")
  4. **Test Case B**: Don't highlight anything ‚Üí Right-click on post ‚Üí Send to n8n
     - Expected: Auto-detection kicks in (may still have issues, but that's okay)
  5. Check n8n webhook data to verify caption accuracy
- **Notes**: This approach is:
  - **Future-proof**: Works regardless of Facebook DOM changes
  - **User-controlled**: 100% accurate when user selects text
  - **Convenient**: Still works automatically if user doesn't select
  - **Simple**: Just ~20 lines of code added
  - **Workflow**: User highlights caption text ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí Send to n8n
- **User Feedback**: ‚úÖ Working as expected - text selection provides 100% accurate captions

**Attempt #3** - [Date: 2025-10-02]
- **Approach**: Auto-Click "See More" Button + View Context Detection
- **Problem Being Solved**: When user doesn't select text, auto-detection still captures unwanted text because:
  - Captions are truncated with "See more" button in feed view
  - Feed view has cluttered DOM with mixed UI elements
  - Extraction happens on partial text
- **Strategy**:
  - **Phase 1**: Detect if in feed view or full post view (URL patterns, DOM structure)
  - **Phase 2**: If in feed view, find and auto-click "See more" button to expand full text
  - **Phase 3**: Wait briefly (150ms) for text expansion
  - **Phase 4**: Extract caption with view-aware strategy:
    - Full post view: More aggressive extraction (cleaner DOM)
    - Feed view: Conservative extraction (more filtering)
- **Implementation**:
  - File: `content.js` around lines 135-140 (before auto-detection)
  - Add view detection: Check URL patterns (`/posts/`, `/permalink/`) and DOM structure
  - Find "See more" button: `div[role="button"]` containing "See more" or "‡∏î‡∏π‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏¥‡πà‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏°"
  - Click button if found, wait 150ms
  - Log which view context detected
  - Adjust extraction selectors based on view
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Success - Ready for Testing
- **Code Changes**:
  - Lines 137-167: View detection and "See More" auto-click
    - Detects full post view via URL patterns (`/posts/`, `/permalink/`, `/photo/`) or single article
    - In feed view: Finds and clicks "See more"/"‡∏î‡∏π‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏¥‡πà‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏°" button
    - Waits 150ms for text expansion
  - Lines 197-213: View-aware extraction strategy
    - Full post view: Min length 10 chars, max nesting 8 (more lenient)
    - Feed view: Min length 20 chars, max nesting 5 (more conservative)
    - Logs which view context was detected
- **Testing Instructions**:
  1. Reload extension in `chrome://extensions`
  2. Refresh Facebook page
  3. **Test Case A (Feed View)**: Right-click on post in timeline (without selecting text)
     - Check console: Should see "Detected: Feed view"
     - Should see "Found 'See more' button, clicking to expand" (if applicable)
     - Check n8n webhook: Caption should have full text, less unwanted text
  4. **Test Case B (Full Post View)**: Click into post ‚Üí Right-click (without selecting text)
     - Check console: Should see "Detected: Full post view"
     - Should NOT see "See more" click attempt
     - Check n8n webhook: Caption should be cleaner
  5. **Test Case C (Selection)**: Still works - highlight text ‚Üí right-click
     - Should bypass all auto-detection (100% accurate)
- **Notes**:
  - User insight: Clicking into post shows full text in cleaner structure
  - This automates that benefit without requiring user workflow change
  - Still has text selection as 100% accurate fallback
  - "See more" button selectors may need adjustment if Facebook changes UI
  - View-aware extraction improves accuracy in both contexts

### Error #2 - popup.js DOM Loading Error
**Date Reported**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: üü° In Progress

#### Problem Description
Chrome extension shows red "Errors" indicator. When clicking on it, shows:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')
```
at `popup.js:28`

This happens because JavaScript tries to access DOM elements (like `scrapeBtn`) before they are loaded.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Load extension in Chrome
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. See red "Errors" button
4. Click "Errors" ‚Üí Shows TypeError

#### Expected Behavior
No errors should appear. Popup should load without issues.

#### Actual Behavior
`document.getElementById('scrapeBtn')` returns `null` because DOM isn't ready when script runs.

#### Error Messages/Logs
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')
Context: popup.html
Stack Trace: popup.js:28 (anonymous function)
```

#### Root Cause Analysis
- `popup.js` runs immediately when loaded
- DOM elements haven't been created yet
- JavaScript tries to attach event listeners to non-existent elements
- All lines accessing `document.getElementById()` fail

**Affected Lines:**
- Line 2: `document.getElementById('webhookUrl')`
- Line 9: `document.getElementById('saveBtn')`
- Line 28: `document.getElementById('scrapeBtn')` ‚Üê First failure

#### Solution Attempts

**Attempt #1** - [Date: 2025-10-02]
- **Approach**: Wrap all code in `DOMContentLoaded` event listener
- **Implementation**:
  - File: `popup.js`
  - Added `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {` at line 2
  - Closed wrapper with `});` at line 294
  - All existing code now runs only after DOM is ready
  - Changed lines: 1-2 (added wrapper start), 294 (added wrapper end)
- **Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Success
- **Outcome**:
  - ‚úÖ DOMContentLoaded IS working (error line shifted from 28 ‚Üí 30, proving wrapper took effect)
  - ‚ùå Error still occurs but at new location (line 30 instead of 28)
  - Root cause was NOT the timing issue - it's a missing HTML element

**Attempt #2** - [Date: 2025-10-02]
- **Approach**: Remove orphaned code that references non-existent elements
- **Root Cause Discovered**:
  - `popup.js` line 30 tries to access `getElementById('scrapeBtn')`
  - But `popup.html` has NO element with id="scrapeBtn"
  - The HTML only has: `webhookUrl` (input) and `saveBtn` (button)
  - The scrape button code is **orphaned code** - button never existed or was removed
- **Implementation**:
  - File: `popup.js`
  - Remove entire scrapeBtn event listener (lines ~30-88)
  - Remove extractPostData function (lines 101-293) - not used by popup
  - Keep only: webhook URL loading, save button, showStatus function
  - Simplify popup.js from 294 lines ‚Üí ~40 lines
- **Rationale**:
  - Scraping is handled by right-click context menu (already working)
  - Popup's purpose is only to manage webhook URL settings
  - No need for duplicate scraping functionality
  - Cleaner, simpler code
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Success - Code Cleaned Up
- **Code Changes**:
  - Removed lines 30-88: Entire `scrapeBtn` event listener (references non-existent button)
  - Removed lines 101-293: `extractPostData` function (not used by popup, content.js handles this)
  - Kept only essential code:
    - Lines 3-8: Load saved webhook URL
    - Lines 10-27: Save webhook URL button handler
    - Lines 29-40: `showStatus` helper function
  - Final file: **41 lines** (down from 294 lines - 86% reduction!)
- **Testing Instructions**:
  1. Reload extension in `chrome://extensions`
  2. Click "Clear all" in Errors page
  3. Click extension icon to open popup
  4. Verify popup loads without errors
  5. Test "Save Webhook URL" button works
  6. Red "Errors" indicator should be gone
- **Notes**:
  - Popup now only manages webhook URL (its intended purpose)
  - All scraping functionality via right-click context menu (working perfectly)
  - Much simpler, cleaner code - easier to maintain

### Error #3 - Photo Modal Detection Failure
**Date Reported**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: üü° In Progress

#### Problem Description
Extension fails to extract post data when user right-clicks while viewing a photo in Facebook's lightbox/modal viewer. Shows error: "Could not find post element".

Works fine when clicking into the full post view, but fails in photo modal.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to Facebook feed/timeline
2. Click on a photo in a post to open the photo viewer/lightbox
3. Right-click on the photo or anywhere in the modal
4. Select "üì§ Send to n8n"
5. Error appears: "Could not find post element"

#### Expected Behavior
Extension should either:
- Extract data from the underlying post (behind the modal), OR
- Show helpful message guiding user to close modal or click into post

#### Actual Behavior
- Generic error: "Could not find post element"
- No guidance on what to do
- User doesn't know why it failed

#### Error Messages/Logs
```
Attempt 1-19: Checking element... (traversing through modal DOM)
‚ö†Ô∏è Could not find post via traversal, trying alternative method...
Found 11 elements with aria-labelledby
‚ùå Could not find post element
```

#### Root Cause Analysis
**Photo Modal DOM Structure:**
```html
<div role="dialog">  <!-- Photo modal overlay -->
  <img>  <!-- The photo user clicked on -->
  <!-- No role="article" inside modal! -->
</div>

<!-- Actual post is BEHIND the modal, not containing it -->
<div role="article">  <!-- Post container (hidden/behind modal) -->
  <div>Post content</div>
</div>
```

When user right-clicks in photo modal:
1. Extension traverses up from clicked element
2. Searches for `role="article"` or post container markers
3. Only finds `role="dialog"` (the modal wrapper)
4. Never finds the actual post container (it's outside the modal)
5. Fails with generic error

**Why full post view works:**
- Full post view has proper `role="article"` structure
- Caption and content are in expected locations
- Post detection succeeds

#### Solution Attempts

**Attempt #1** - [Date: 2025-10-02]
- **Approach**: Hybrid - Detect modal, try to find underlying post, fallback to helpful message
- **Strategy**:
  - Phase 1: Detect if clicked element is inside `[role="dialog"]` (photo modal)
  - Phase 2: If in modal, try to find `[role="article"]` in main document (outside modal)
  - Phase 3: If underlying post found, extract from it
  - Phase 4: If not found, show specific helpful error message instead of generic one
- **Implementation**:
  - File: `content.js`
  - Add modal detection after click tracking (around line 415)
  - Add logic to search for post outside modal
  - Update error message at line ~501 to be context-aware
- **Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Success - Found Bug During Testing
- **Bug Found**:
  - Photo modal detection works perfectly ‚úÖ
  - Underlying post extraction works ‚úÖ
  - BUT: ReferenceError at line 509: "attempts is not defined"
  - Variable `attempts` scoped inside conditional block, referenced outside
- **Code Changes**:
  - **Lines 410-421**: Photo modal detection
    - Traverses up from clicked element looking for `role="dialog"`
    - Sets `inPhotoModal` flag if found
  - **Lines 423-452**: Underlying post extraction
    - When in modal, searches for `[role="article"]` in main document
    - Takes single post if only one exists
    - If multiple, finds first visible one
  - **Lines 454-507**: Normal traversal (if not in modal or modal extraction failed)
    - Wrapped existing traversal logic in conditional
    - Only runs if modal extraction didn't find a post
  - **Lines 550-560**: Context-aware error messages
    - If in photo modal: "üì∏ You're viewing a photo. Please close the photo viewer and right-click on the post, or click 'See post' to view the full post first."
    - Otherwise: Generic error message
- **Testing Instructions**:
  1. Reload extension in `chrome://extensions`
  2. Go to Facebook feed
  3. **Test Case A**: Click photo to open lightbox ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí Send to n8n
     - Expected: Should extract from underlying post OR show helpful message
     - Check console: Should see "üì∏ Detected photo modal/lightbox"
  4. **Test Case B**: Click into full post ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí Send to n8n
     - Expected: Works normally (already confirmed working)
  5. **Test Case C**: Select text in photo modal ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí Send to n8n
     - Expected: Text selection still takes priority (100% accurate)
- **Notes**:
  - Hybrid solution: Attempts smart extraction first, gives helpful guidance if it fails
  - Maintains text selection as ultimate fallback
  - User gets clear actionable message instead of generic error

**Attempt #2** - [Date: 2025-10-02]
- **Approach**: Fix variable scoping bug
- **Problem**: `attempts` variable declared inside conditional block (line 460) but referenced outside (line 509)
- **Implementation**:
  - Move `let attempts = 0;` and `const maxAttempts = 50;` declarations outside the conditional
  - Declare them before the `if (!postElement || postElement === lastClickedElement)` block
  - This makes them available in both the traversal path AND the check at line 509
- **Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial - Fixed bug but introduced new errors
- **Outcome**: Led to more complexity and new failure points

**Decision:** [Date: 2025-10-02] **Simplified Approach - Stop trying to extract from photo modal**
- **Rationale**:
  - Photo modal extraction attempts kept introducing new bugs
  - Complexity not worth the marginal benefit
  - User already has working workflow: Click into full post
  - Text selection always available as 100% accurate fallback
- **New Implementation** (content.js lines 410-430):
  - Keep photo modal DETECTION (check for `role="dialog"`)
  - Instead of trying to extract, show helpful error message:
    - "üì∏ You're viewing a photo. Please close the photo viewer or click 'See post' to view the full post, then right-click to extract."
    - "Tip: You can also highlight the caption text and right-click for 100% accurate extraction."
  - User gets clear actionable guidance
- **Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial - Introduced false positive bug

**Attempt #3** - [Date: 2025-10-02] **Fix False Positive Detection**
- **Problem Found**: Photo modal detection too broad
  - Checked only `role="dialog"`
  - But Facebook's full post view ALSO uses `role="dialog"`
  - Extension incorrectly blocked extraction in full post view
- **Solution**: Add URL pattern check to distinguish dialog types
  - Photo modal URLs contain: `/photo/`, `/photo.php`, or `photo_id=`
  - Full post URLs contain: `/posts/`, `/permalink/`
  - Now only blocks if BOTH dialog role AND photo URL pattern match
- **Implementation** (content.js lines 415-427):
  ```javascript
  if (role === 'dialog') {
    const url = window.location.href;
    if (url.includes('/photo/') || url.includes('/photo.php') || url.includes('photo_id=')) {
      inPhotoModal = true;  // Real photo modal
    } else {
      // Full post dialog - allow extraction
    }
  }
  ```
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Success - Ready for Testing
- **Testing**: Full post view should now work correctly

### Error #4 - Caption Extraction Gets Comments Instead of Actual Caption
**Date Reported**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: üü° In Progress

#### Problem Description
After fixing photo modal detection (Error #3), caption extraction now picks up the first comment text instead of the actual post caption. This affects BOTH photo modal extraction AND full post view - both methods now send comment text as "caption" to n8n webhook.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to Facebook
2. Either: Click into full post view OR open photo modal
3. Right-click ‚Üí "Send to n8n" (without selecting text)
4. Check n8n webhook data
5. Caption field contains first comment, not actual post caption

#### Expected Behavior
Caption should contain the actual post text written by the author, not comment text.

#### Actual Behavior
First comment in the post is extracted as the caption.

#### Root Cause Analysis
**Comments Section Detection Failure:**
- Current detection: `element.closest('[aria-label*="comment" i]')` (lines 206-208)
- This selector is insufficient - Facebook comment sections may not have `aria-label="comment"`
- Comments aren't being filtered out, so they're treated as valid caption candidates

**DOM Order Issue:**
- Caption extraction iterates through `div[dir="auto"]` elements in DOM order
- In some Facebook layouts, first comment appears BEFORE actual caption in DOM
- Or caption and comments are siblings without clear container distinction
- Extraction takes FIRST element that passes filters ‚Üí Gets comment instead of caption

**Why it affects both views:**
- Photo modal extraction finds underlying `[role="article"]` ‚úÖ
- But that article contains BOTH caption AND comments
- Same faulty caption extraction runs on that element
- Full post view has same issue

#### Possible Solutions

**Solution A: Strengthen Comments Detection**
- Add more comment section identifiers:
  - Check for nested `[role="article"]` (comments are often nested articles)
  - Look for "Write a comment" text nearby
  - Check for "Most relevant" dropdown
  - Parent containers with comment-related classes
- More comprehensive filtering

**Solution B: Position-Based Filtering (RECOMMENDED)**
- Caption is ALWAYS in top portion of post (first 30-40% of height)
- Comments are ALWAYS below engagement buttons (Like, Comment, Share)
- Filter: Only consider elements that appear BEFORE engagement section
- More robust than trying to detect all comment container variations

**Solution C: Find Engagement Section as Delimiter**
- Locate "Like Comment Share" buttons
- Only search for caption ABOVE these buttons
- Everything below = comments section
- Clear boundary between caption and comments

**Solution D: Combine A + B + C**
- Use all three strategies for maximum reliability
- Multiple layers of filtering

#### Solution Attempts

**Attempt #1** - [Date: 2025-10-02]
- **Approach**: Combine Solutions A + B + C - Complex multi-strategy filtering
- **Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Failed - Introduced new bugs, caused more errors
- **Outcome**: Code became too complex, hard to debug, kept failing in different ways

**Decision:** [Date: 2025-10-02] **Reverted to Simpler Version + Rely on User Workflow**
- **Rationale**:
  - Complex comment filtering kept breaking
  - Added too many failure points
  - Original simple version works fine in full post view
